# Phase III: Usability Evaluation

Group Members: Felicia Cruz, Joseph Macam, and Anthony Brackett

Project: Task Management System

## Executive Summary

* We designed a protocol to use for our our usabilty test.
* We created a spreadsheet that we will use to store data collected during our usability test.
* We converted our wireframe into an interactive prototype using Adobe XD.

## Protocol Explanation

### Background

*Question 1* <br/>
We want information regarding what type of other task management systems our user's have used before that may have not been very user friendly. This information will help us in seeing what other task management systems our userbase uses and to hopefully give us an idea of common functionality to assist the learnability of our product.

*Question 2* <br/>
This will help us determine if there are specific features that our user's whom have used a task managment system before are looking for and if we should consider adding those features to our product if we do not currently have those features.

*Question 3* <br/>
If our participants haven't used task management before this question will help us determine if there is a market for our product and if people would be interested in using it because they think it would be useful for them.


### Tasks

*Task 1* <br/>
For this task we hope to gather data that will give us insight into how our potential user's interact with our application and whether or not our participants will be able to successfully create tasks and from which view they created the tasks from. This information will help us gain some information on whether or not our application works effectively and is error tolerant.

*Task 2* <br/>
For this task we want to see if our participant is able to add an additional email to the app. This data will help us determine how efficient our multiple account feature is and if our user's are able to interact with multiple accounts successfully without running into any errors. 

*Task 3* <br/>
For this task we want to see if our participant is able to set a task as complete. This information will help us determine if our task completion functionality learnability needs any improvement and whether or not it is effective in completing tasks.

### Wrap Up

*Question 1* <br/>
We would like to know what features of our application our participants like most and this will help highlight what features of our application are most useful to our users. 

*Question 2* <br/>
We would like to know what features of our application or participants did not like and this will help us determine what parts of our application are not very useful to our users and it can help us see what parts of our application were not very effective.

*Question 3* <br/>
This question will help us see what features our user's would like to see in our application which will help us increase the overall utility/usefulness of our application for our user's by adding features they want.

*Question 4* <br/>
This question will gain information about what the participant thinks of specific features of our application. These additional user inputs will give us a better perspective of how well our product performed, if it was effective in accomplishing the tasks presented, and to allow the user to present any issues they believe are important.

*Question 5* <br/>
This question is to gain any additional thoughts the user may have that we might not have covered during the evaluation.

## Overall Approach of Study
For this Usability Test study, our goals are to gauge the efficiency and effectiveness of using this app for task management, gauge the error recovery and tolerance when using this app, and to determine the overall utility/usefullness of this app for our user's daily task management. Because of this, we went with a formmative approach in which we focus on **how** the user is using the app. We have also gone with the think-aloud approach since our study is interested in our participant's though process while going through the tasks.
