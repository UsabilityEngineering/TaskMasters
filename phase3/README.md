# Phase III: Usability Evaluation

Group Members: Felicia Cruz, Joseph Macam, and Anthony Brackett

Project: Task Management System

## Executive Summary

* We designed a protocol to use for our our usabilty test.
* We created a spreadsheet that we will use to store data collected during our usability test.
* We converted our wireframe into an interactive prototype using Adobe XD.

## Protocol Explanation

### Background

**Question 1** <br/>
Want information regarding what type of other task management systems our user's have used before that may have not been very user friendly. This information will help us in seeing what other task management systems have done wrong in terms of learnability and we will make sure to avoid the same mistakes.

**Question 2** <br/>
Will help us determine if there our specific features that our user's whom have used a task managment system before are looking for and if we should consider adding those features to our product if we do not currently have those features.

**Question 3** <br/>
If our participants haven't used task management before this question will help us determine if there is a market for our product and if people would be interested in using it because they think it would be useful for them.


### Tasks

**Task 1** <br/>
For this task we hope to gather data that will give us insight into how our potential user's interact with our application and whether or not our participants will be able to successfully create tasks and from which view they created the tasks from. This information will help us gain some information on whether or not our application works effectively and is error tolerant.

**Task 2** <br/>
For this task we want to see if our participant wants to combine the tasks from multiple accounts and if they would be able to accomplish that goal. This data will help us determine how efficient our multiple account feature is and if our user's are able to interact with multiple accounts successfully without running into any errors. 

**Task 3** <br/>
We want the participant to go through the process again of adding another task and see if they would follow the same steps as they did earlier in task one or if they decided to take a different approach. This information will help us determine if our application is easy for our users to use by being efficient because we want our application to make the lives of our users easier by being useful not make our user's lives more difficult.

### Wrap Up

**Question 1** <br/>
We would like to know what features of our application our participants like most and this will help highlight what features of our application are most useful to our users.

**Question 2** <br/>
We would like to know what features of our application or participants did not like and this will help us determine what parts of our application are not very useful to our users and it can help us see what parts of our application were not very effective.

**Question 3** <br/>
This question will help us see what features our user's would like to see in our application which will help us increase the overall usefulness of our application for our user's by adding features they want.

**Question 4** <br/>
This question will gain information about what the participant thinks of specific features of our application. This is important informatiion because this information will tell us if our features our easy to use for our user's and if they are effective.

**Question 5** <br/>
This question is to gain any additional thoughts the user may have that we might not have covered during the evaluation.
