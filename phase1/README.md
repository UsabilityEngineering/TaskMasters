# Task Masters, Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

Group Members: Felicia Cruz, Joseph Macam, and Anthony Brackett

Project: Task Management System

## Methods
- Investigated user-reported methods of task management
  - Gathered **first-hand accounts** of systems currently employed
  - Solution will **magnify strengths and minimize weaknesses** of current systems
- **Contextual Inquiry** with potential customers (n=5) revealed commonly used systems’ strengths
- **Online Survey** collected demographic information from potential customers (n=20)

## Findings
-	Majority (95%) of **survey respondents** are **full-time students**
	- 57% of full-time students **do not use** a task manager
	- Full time students think a task management system **will improve daily life** (M=15.6,sd=4.2)
- Potential customers who **use task management systems** consider themselves to be organized
	- Potential customers who use task management **are organized** (M=6.2, sd=3.5)  vs those who don’t (M=7.4, sd=3.5)
	- Potential customers who use task management think it will improve daily life(M=7.4,sd=4.1)
- Potential customers who **do not use task management systems** think it will **improve daily life**	
	- 55% of potential customers do not use task management vs 45% of potential customers do not use task management
	- Potential customers who do not use task management think that it will improve daily life (M=9.2,sd=4.2)
- Using **contextual inquiry** determined **commonly used time management tools and their strengths** 
	- 100% of respondents **use a software tool to manage their tasks** - 40% use Trello, 40% use Sticky Notes, and 20% uses Notion
	- Sticky notes strengths - allows users to organize tasks, cross off/delete completed tasks, can sync between all microsoft devices 
	- Notion strengths - ideal for note taking, organizing, and creating schedules
	- Trello weakness - Not very user friendly

## Conclusions
- From our **online survey** and **contextual inquiry** we discovered valuable information that will help us with our design
	- Will **improve quality of life** for users by providing **safety** through preventing disorganization because based on our survey results we found that most potential
		customers think task management would improve their daily life
	- Our product is **useful to anyone regardless of their schedule complexity** and based on our survey results we found that our potential users are **students, employees, 				parents, athlete/fitness, and personal business owners**
	- Provide an easy to use user interface that is **learnable, error tolerant, and  memorable** because in our contextual inquiry we found that other time management tools(ex: 		Trello) were **not very user friendly**.
	- Features will be **efficient and satisfying** by making it easy to schedule tasks through **providing good feedback** because we learned from our contextual inquiry user’s 		like how easy it is to schedule tasks and mark them completed in the software tools they use
	- Product will have **effective features** just like others on the market so a feature will be added to **sync tasks between multiple devices** because we learned from our
	  contextual inquiry user’s liked that Microsoft sticky notes syncs between all Microsoft devices

## Caveats
- **Contextual inquiry method limitations**
	- Only able to get data from 5 users therefore we were only about to get information about 3 task management tools instead of a bigger range
	- Initial assumptions were that were were going to get many strengths and weaknesses of other tools but we only were able to get descriptions of strengths and not really 
		weaknesses
- **Online survey method limitations**
	- Our survey results told us that our data was heavily skewed for our potential user's schedule complexities (95% full time students)
	- Initial assumptions were that we were going to recieve a wide range of schedule complexites from our users
