# Scenarios

## (A) John's Scenario

When John got home from school he decided to call his parents and he let them know that he has been getting stressed out and having a hard time managing all of his work he has to do. They recommended to him that maybe he should try to use some form of task management to get keep track of all his tasks. So after he was done speaking to his parents John reached out to one of his roommates to see how he stays organized.

## (B) Sarah's Scenario

One day Sarah returned home late from work and was going to start working on a homework assignment that was due the next day at 11.59 pm.
